## Installation

- [Create a discord bot](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) and [add it to your server](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#creating-and-using-your-invite-link) with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scope
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.6 or newer
- Clone/[Download](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the repo, rename the `config.json.example` file to `config.json` and put your bot token into it.
- [Open a command prompt in the same folder](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-from-right-click-menu#:~:text=To%20open%20a%20command%20prompt%20window%20in%20any%20folder%2C%20simply,the%20same%20inside%20any%20folder.) and type `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run [SkinPeek.js](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/blob/master/SkinPeek.js) using `node SkinPeek.js` in the command prompt
- Give the bot a [role](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ) that allows it to send messages and create custom emojis
- Send `!deploy guild` or `!deploy global` to deploy the commands.

### Useful Information

- Deploying in the guild happens instantly but the commands can only be used in that guild. Deploying globally can take up to an hour due to Discord's caching.  
  - If you deployed both globally and in a guild, you will see every command twice. In that case, just send `!undeploy guild`!

- By default, the bot doesn't store your username/password, it only uses them to get the cookies that can be used to generate access tokens needed to get your shop.  
  - You can log in using [your auth.riotgames.com cookies](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/wiki/How-to-get-your-Riot-cookies) using `/cookies` to avoid sending your password, and you can delete your account from the bot using `/forget`.  
  - Obviously, only log in if you trust whoever is hosting the bot, as they can theoretically do anything with your account.

- If you're bored, check out [this writeup](https://gist.github.com/giorgi-o/e0fc2f6160a5fd43f05be8567ad6fdd7) on how Riot treats third-party projects like this one.

### Replit

[![Run on Repl.it](https://replit.com/badge/github/Gam3rBoy57/SkinPeekReplit)](https://replit.com/github/Gam3rBoy57/SkinPeekReplit)  
Thanks to Gam3rBoy57 for maintaining the Replit version!  
**Note:** You will probably have to `/login` every day, and your alerts most likely won't work. Read more [here](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/pull/46#issuecomment-1213579690).


### Docker

For advanced users who want to deploy the bot using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/):

- [Create a discord bot](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) and [add it to your server](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#creating-and-using-your-invite-link) with the  bot and `applications.commands` scope
- Create a docker-compose file like [this](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and a config file like [this](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/blob/master/config.json.example)
- Put your bot token in [config.json](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/blob/master/config.json.example)
- Use `docker-compose up -d` to start the bot, `docker-compose logs -f` to see the logs and `docker-compose down` to stop it.
- Send `!deploy guild` to deploy in the current guild or `!deploy global` to deploy the commands globally.

Special thanks to [Mistral](https://github.com/blongnh), [Jukki](https://github.com/Kyedae) and [Keny](https://github.com/pandakeny) for their countless bug reports, suggestions and feedback, and without whom the bot wouldn't be anywhere near as good as what it is today.

## Translations

If you are fluent in another language and would like help translate the bot, please do!

1. Look up the language code for your language [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales)
2. Look in the bot's `languages` folder
3. If you're starting from scratch, copy the `en-GB.json` file and rename it to your language code
4. Open the file and do the thing

Once you're done translating, you can either [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [open a GitHub pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), or you can just send me the JSON on discord and I'll upload it for you.

Thank you! :)
